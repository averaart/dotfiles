# My dotfiles

These are my dotfiles. Originally they were based on Mathias Bynens' [excellent and famous dotfiles](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles), but Daan "[DandyDev](https://github.com/DandyDev)" Debie changed so much that it wasn't useful anymore to keep his repo as a fork. This is a fork of Daan's version.

## Installation

### Using Git and the bootstrap script

You can clone the repository wherever you want. (I like to keep it in `~/projects/tools/dotfiles`, with `~/dotfiles` as a symlink.) The bootstrapper script will pull in the latest version and copy the files to your home folder.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/averaart/dotfiles.git && cd dotfiles && source bootstrap.sh
```

To update, `cd` into your local `dotfiles` repository and then:

```bash
source bootstrap.sh
```

Alternatively, to update while avoiding the confirmation prompt:

```bash
set -- -f; source bootstrap.sh
```

### Git-free install

To install these dotfiles without Git:

```bash
cd; curl -#L https://github.com/averaart/dotfiles/tarball/master | tar -xzv --strip-components 1 --exclude={README.md,bootstrap.sh}
```

To update later on, just run that command again.

### Specify the `$PATH`

If `~/.path` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files, before any feature testing (such as [detecting which version of `ls` is being used](https://github.com/mathiasbynens/dotfiles/blob/aff769fd75225d8f2e481185a71d5e05b76002dc/.aliases#L21-26)) takes place.

Here’s an example `~/.path` file that adds `~/utils` to the `$PATH`:

```bash
export PATH="$HOME/utils:$PATH"
```

### Add custom commands without creating a new fork

If `~/.extra` exists, it will be sourced along with the other files. You can use this to add a few custom commands without the need to fork this entire repository, or to add commands you don’t want to commit to a public repository.

My `~/.extra` looks something like this:

```bash
# PATH additions
export PATH="~/bin:$PATH"
```

You can also use `~/.extra` to override settings, functions and aliases from my dotfiles repository.

### Your git author info and credentials

You can add a `.gitconfig_credentials` file to your _dotfiles_ directory where you can store your git user information and Github credentials. The `bootstrap.sh` script will tack the contents to the `.gitconfig` file it copies. Of course, this file will be ignored in the dotfiles git repository.

### Installing dependencies

Some of these dotfiles depend on certain CLI utilities to be installed (Homebrew etc.) Install those dependencies:

```bash
./install-deps.sh
```

This in turn calls `.brew` and `.pythondeps` because there were some interdependencies.

### Install Homebrew formulae

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to install some common Homebrew formulae (after installing Homebrew, of course):

```bash
./.brew
```

### Install Python dependencies

Some of these dotfiles assume Python development to be present. To make sure it is, run the following:

```bash
./.pythondeps
```

### Sensible OS X defaults

When setting up a new Mac, you may want to set some sensible OS X defaults:

```bash
./.osx
```
